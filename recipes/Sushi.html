<p><h1>Description</h1></p>

<p>If you’re new to making sushi - one of Japan's most famed dishes - this is a great basic recipe to start with. You really only need a few ingredients to make it, including sushi rice (vinegared rice), nori sheets, fresh salmon and avocado.

    Our Digital Food Director Amira Georgy recently retested this recipe (see more of her notes below) and confirmed what many of our members have been saying for years: it’s so simple, works every time and is a great base for adding different fillings or trying variations.
    
    Her top tip: use a super-sharp knife! Yes, while making the sushi rice or rolling the sushi might seem like the hard parts, it’s actually the cutting which is many people’s downfall. Using a super sharp knife will not only help you cut beautifully thin slices of fish, but it will prevent you from squashing the sushi rolls as you cut them and losing that distinct round shape. Using a damp cloth or towel to wipe the blade clean between cuts helps, too.
