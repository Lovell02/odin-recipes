<p> <h1>Description</h1> </p>

<p>Matt Preston says that, "A great burger has a balance of crunch, creaminess, freshness, saltiness and tang to contrast with the crusty-edged meat and soft bun. It also has a structural integrity that means the middle doesn’t drop out the back on the first bite!"

<h1>Steps:</h1>

<ol>

<li>Line a baking tray with baking paper. Warm the butter in a frypan over medium heat and slowly cook the onion and sugar, stirring occasionally, for 40 minutes or until onion caramelises.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, mix the mince, sausage meat (if using) and spring onion. Add Tabasco or Dijon mustard, sesame seeds and a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Using your hands, just combine the meat.</li>
<li>Using wet hands, form mince mixture into 4 cricket-sized balls and place on the tray. Press patties flat so they are the same diameter as your bread rolls. Using the back of a spoon, press down to form a little well in the centre of each patty (to offset the swelling in the middle that tends to come when cooking the meat). Chill burgers for at least 30 minutes or until you need them.</li>
<li>Combine the lettuce and cabbage. Dress with a squeeze of lemon juice.</li>
<li>Heat a barbecue or chargrill pan to high heat. Chargrill bread rolls (outsides first) and lightly butter insides. Set aside.</li>
<li>Chargrill the patties for 4-5 minutes each side, depending on the thickness - they don't need to be cooked through. Cook bacon, turning, for the final 3-4 minutes until starting to crisp.</li>
<li>Lay a slice of cheese over each patty. Cut the bacon rashers into 4 pieces and push into the cheese. Keep the burgers warm so the cheese melts.</li>
<li>In a dry frypan, cook the pineapple, turning, over medium heat for 1-2 minutes until it gets a little tanned.</li>
<li>To assemble the burgers, place some caramelised onion on the base of each bun. Top with patties and some tomato sauce. Now, put on the pineapple rings. Scatter a handful of the lettuce mixture over each burger. Spread mayo on the bun tops, anchor 2-3 tomato slices in the mayo and then place on top of the lettuce mixture. Serve with salty fries.</li>
